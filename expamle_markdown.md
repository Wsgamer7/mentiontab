## **We're looking for Mid-Market Account Executives to join us on our mission of giving developers superpowers through AI.**

**ABOUT US**

Featured on the Forbes AI 50 list, Windsurf (formerly Codeium) has risen to become a leader in the AI developer tools space. In just over a year since our product launched, Windsurf has given over a thousand enterprise customers and hundreds of thousands of end users access to generative AI directly in their IDE.

Through our agentic, AI native IDE, Windsurf and Windsurf Plugin, Windsurf generates 42% of the code our end users commit, accelerating product release velocity by 18% in the Enterprise. Our state-of-the-art proprietary language models, inference stack and enterprise-grade security make Windsurf the tool of choice for enterprise customers.

We're one of the fastest growing AI startups – focusing on product, revenue, and customer experience which has led to substantial revenue growth and enterprise traction. **We work hard, and we operate with a high degree of trust, agency, and ownership.**

**HIGHLIGHTS:**

- [Series C Announcement](https://codeium.com/blog/series-c-annoucement)
- [Windsurf Launch](https://codeium.com/blog/windsurf-launch)
- [Forbes 2024 AI Top 50](https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/?sh=7ef7b753290f)
- [Forbes Startup Feature](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2024/08/13/this-ai-coding-engine-can-process-100-million-lines-of-code-at-once/)

**WHAT YOU’LL DO**

- Source, close and expand net new logos within a given territory
- Have the ability to navigate complex organizational structures and identify executive sponsors and champions
- Research and understand the business objectives of your customers and have the ability to perform a value driven sales cycle
- Collaborate with internal partners to move deals forward and ensure customer success
- Consistently deliver ARR revenue targets and drive success through a metric based approach
- Provide timely and insightful input back to other corporate functions
- Create ROI and business justification reports based off of a data driven approach
- Run tight POVs based off of business success criteria

**WHAT YOU’LL BRING**

- We’re looking for A-players with insanely high adaptability, who thrive in (somewhat chaotic) early stages of company building.
- Intense operational rigor (MEDDPICC, Challenger, Command of Message, etc) coupled with customer obsession.
- 2+ years in a SaaS sales closing role, with 6+ quarters of demonstrated success (bonus points if you have worked with infrastructure)
- Ability to learn and become an expert quickly, on both our product and how prospects/customers use AI code generation to have real, quantifiable impacts on their business.
- Team player – We value simplifiers, not complexifiers.
- Self-starter – Hunger to dream up, plan, and execute tasks independently.
- Interfacing with our customers to explain Windsurf and its technology to Mid Market customers and prospects.
- Strong preference on familiarity with AI-powered developer tools (or strong understanding of AI/LLMs) like Windsurf, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.

**WHAT WE BELIEVE**

We have the opportunity to build a generational company, and executing that vision requires us to work together. **Our Austin team works 5 days a week in our office in downtown Austin, TX.**

Only a small handful of companies have built career-defining sales teams. We’re on a mission to build the next one. That starts with setting the bar for talent extremely high.

Even the best sales reps are never a finished product. World-class enablement is key to a world-class sales organization and a competitive advantage. We have hired one of the best teams in the industry to ensure everyone is constantly getting better.

We’re not a family, but many of our employees have them (fur babies included). Codeium offers several [benefits and perks](https://codeium.com/careers) to make sure everyone is cared for – including but not limited to:

- Competitive comp plan
- Comprehensive benefits (medical, dental, vision)
- 401K, equity
- Catered lunches, fully stocked kitchen, swag, etc.
- Team events & activities
- Downtown parking

If your experience is close but doesn’t fulfil all requirements, please apply. To achieve our goals, we are focused on hiring teammates with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Windsurf is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, reproductive health decisions, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, genetic information, political views or activity, or other applicable legally protected characteristics. We also consider qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law.

By submitting your application, you acknowledge that Windsurf will process your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
